# NexTemplate

Hey there, welcome to NexTemplate â€“ my personal indie project! This collection brings together custom templates and components crafted with Next.JS, shadcn/ui, and TailwindCSS. It's a space where I share pieces of code that might make your web development journey a bit smoother.

## Features

1. **Diverse Collection**: NexTemplate offers a bunch of reusable templates and components that I've put together. They're not perfect, but they've been useful for me, and I hope you find them helpful too.

2. **Search Functionality**: Need something specific? Use the search feature to quickly find the components you're looking for.

3. **Live Demos**: See the components in action with live demos. The demos include code snippets in TypeScript, CSS, and Tailwind for your convenience.

4. **Code Organization**: I've tried to organize the components into different files, following some good practices for clarity. It's not perfect, but it gets the job done.

5. **Easy Copy-Paste Integration**: Feel free to copy and paste the code snippets directly into your project. It's a quick and straightforward way to integrate these components.

6. **Fully Open Sourced**: NexTemplate is fully open source. Dive into the code, make changes, and use it as you see fit. Just remember, it's not perfect, and I'm always open to improvements.
