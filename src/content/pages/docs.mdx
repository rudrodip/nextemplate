# Adding a New Component

<Callout>
  READ this carefully before adding a new component. Creating new component can
  be tricky, so if you have any questions, feel free to [contact
  me](https://twitter.com/rds_agi).
</Callout>

If you'd like to contribute a new component to NexTemplate, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Component Location**: Place the new component in the `src/components/templates/<component_folder>` directory.

2. **Mandatory Files**: Each component folder must include the following two files:

   - `component-details.json`: Contains metadata about the component.
   - `main.tsx`: Should export the component as the default export.

3. **Component Details Metadata**:

   - The `component-details.json` file must export an object of type `ComponentDetails`.
   - Example of `ComponentDetails` type:
     ```typescript
     export type ComponentDetails = {
       title: string;
       desc: string;
       tags: string[];
       published: boolean;
       date: string; // Format: "2024-01-12T17:20:00.000Z"
     };
     ```
   - Ensure that the `date` string follows the specified JavaScript format.

4. **File Structure**: There can be multiple files within the component folder, but subdirectories are not allowed.

## Deployment

To deploy NexTemplate, you can use your preferred hosting platform. Here's a general guide:

1. **Build your app**:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm run build
# or
bun run build
```

2. **Deploy to your platform of choice**:

   - If using Vercel, connect your GitHub repository, and Vercel will handle the deployment seamlessly.
   - For other platforms, upload the contents of the `out/` directory generated after the build to your server.

3. **Visit your deployed site**: Open your browser and visit your deployed site to ensure everything is working as expected.
